// Write a program that classifies students based on their scores stored in an object. The object contains student names
//  as keys and their scores as values. You need to print each student’s name along with their grade based on 
// the following conditions:

// Score >= 90 → "A"
// Score >= 80 and < 90 → "B"
// Score >= 70 and < 80 → "C"
// Score >= 60 and < 70 → "D"
// Score < 60 → "F"
// You must use a for-in loop to iterate through the object.
