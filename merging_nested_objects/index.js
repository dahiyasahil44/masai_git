// You are given two nested objects: profile and updates. Your task is to merge the two objects using the spread operator
// , ensuring that specific nested properties in updates overwrite those in profile.

// Steps:
// Create two objects:
// profile: contains name, age, address (which is an object with properties like city and zipcode).
// updates: contains updated age, and an updated address object with a new zipcode and added country property.
// Merge the objects using the spread operator, ensuring the updated properties from updates overwrite the existing ones.
// Return the new merged object.

const profile = { name: "Charlie", age: 29, address: { city: "San Francisco", zipcode: "94101" } };
const updates = { age: 30, address: { zipcode: "94109", country: "USA" } };

const user = {...profile, ...updates};

console.log(user);
